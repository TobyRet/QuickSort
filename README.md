#Quicksort in Java

Quicksort (sometimes called partition-exchange sort) is an efficient sorting algorithm, serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of an array in order. 
When implemented well, it can be about two or three times faster than its main competitors, merge sort and heapsort.
